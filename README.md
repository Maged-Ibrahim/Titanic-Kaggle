# Titanic-Kaggle
This project is about analysis of the Kaggle (Titanic survival prediction competition), I trained a ML model to learn the relationship between passenger and their survival outcome to make survival predictions on that given passenger data, with highlighting on important data that need to be noticed among all this data. I performed data manipulation operations as well as data cleaning.
